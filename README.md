## About the OLHZN-Track Software

This is originally a fork of David Akerman's FlexTrack library: https://github.com/daveake/FlexTrack

This is an Arduino based radio position tracking & data logging system intended for high altitude weather balloons flights.

This code provides transmission of radio telemetry via APRS as well as telemetry logging on OLHZN Arduino Mega compatible circuit boards for High Altitude Ballooning.

## Buy an OLHZN Circuit Board

This code is designed for our OLHZN Arduino Mega compatible circuit board (Revision 5). You're certainly welcome to use and adapt this code for your own projects, but you can also purchase one of our circuit boards here: http://overlookhorizon.com/buy-circuit-boards

A parts list and assembly instructions for our OLHZN Circuit Boards can be found here: [/OLHZN_Track/Documentation/](https://github.com/OverlookHorizon/OLHZN_Track/tree/master/Documentation)


## How to launch a high altitude weather balloon

Need further guidance on cameras, balloons, parachutes, etc.? See our how-to guide here: http://overlookhorizon.com/how-to

## Disclaimer

The OLHZN_Track code is provided as is with no guarantees of performance or operation. 

If you decide to use this code under a balloon it is your responsibility to ensure you comply with the local legislation and laws regarding unmanned free meteorological balloon launching and airborne radio transmission.

The Radiometrix HX-1 144.390 MHz is NOT license exempt in the United States of America and does need an amateur radio license issued by the FCC.

Use of APRS requires an amateur radio  license in all countries and a number of countries donâ€™t permit the airborne use of APRS under any circumstances. 

It is YOUR responsibility to ensure your hardware and code is used safely and legally.
