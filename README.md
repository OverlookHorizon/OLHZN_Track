## OLHZN_Track 

This is a fork of David Akerman's FlexTrack library: https://github.com/daveake/FlexTrack

This is an Arduino Mega based APRS radio tracking system for high altitude weather balloons.

This code provides simultaneous (where legal and supported by the hardware installed) transmission of radio telemetry via RTTY and APRS on OLHZN Arduino circuit boards for High Altitude Ballooning.

## Disclaimer

The OLHZN_Track code is provided as is with no guarantees of performance or operation. 

If you decide to use this code under a balloon it’s your responsibility to ensure you comply with the local legislation and laws regarding meteorological balloon launching and radio transmission in the air.

The Radiometrix HX-1 144.390 MHz is NOT license exempt in the United States of America and does need an amateur radio license issued by the FCC.

Use of APRS requires an amateur radio  license in all countries and a number of countries don’t permit the airborne use of APRS under any circumstances. 

It is YOUR responsibility to ensure your hardware and code is used safely and legally.
